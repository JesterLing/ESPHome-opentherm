<h2>Thermostat</h2>
<p>Thermostat has 2 modes - pid, manual. In manual mode, you can set the idle interval between heating. So the boiler is not clocking and does not work hard. Warm floor / radiators have time to give off heat. This behavior was peeped from the original Bosch CR10 thermostat that I had before.</p>
